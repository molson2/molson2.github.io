We present a multivariate one-sided sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies, appropriate when the researcher has specified that a given causal mechanism should manifest itself in effects on multiple outcome variables in a known direction. The test statistic can be thought of as the solution to an adversarial game, where the researcher determines the best linear combination of test statistics to combat natureâ€™s presentation of the worst-case pattern of hidden bias. The corresponding optimization problem is convex, and can be solved efficiently even for reasonably sized observational studies. Asymptotically the test statistic converges to a chi-bar-squared distribution under the null, a common distribution in order restricted statistical inference. The test attains the largest possible design sensitivity over a class of coherent test statistics, and facilitates one-sided sensitivity analyses for individual outcome variables while maintaining familywise error control through is incorporation into closed testing procedures.
