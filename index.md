I am currently a quantitative researcher at the [Voleon Group](https://voleon.com/), a hedge fund in the Bay Area with ML-based investment strategies.  I received my PhD in statistics in 2018 from the [Wharton Statistics Department](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, and my B.S in mathematics and economics from the University of Chicago in 2010.  Before graduate school I spent a few years working in the macroeconomic policy group of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

My research interests include applied optimization, boosting algorithms, deep learning, and scientific computing.  I also have a consulting experience over the past five years in areas ranging from oil well analytics to emergency department patient flow visualization.
